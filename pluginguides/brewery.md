Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting.

## Distilling

1. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand
2. Put glowstone dust as filter on top into the brewing stand (The filter will not be consumed)

## Aging

A barrel is needed for aging. It can be build in two ways:

**Small barrel**

Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape.

Place a Sign on the lower right side and write "Barrel" in the upper Line:

Message "Barrel created" should appear.


**Big barrel**

Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape.
Attach a Spigot (Fence) and a Sign that has "Barrel" written on the first Line:

Message "Barrel created" should appear  
You may remove the Sign from the Big Barrel after creating it.

------


The small Barrel is opened with a right click on the sign, the big barrel with a right click on the spigot (fence).

Put the Bottles into the Barrels for aging.  
Depending on the Recipe the Type of wood used may alter the quality of the aged Brew.
