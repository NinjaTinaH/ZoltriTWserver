### Intro to QuickShop

Quickshop is the way to make chest shops on the server.

For more help, type in "/qs help" in chat for more commands.

### How to make a QuickShop

1) Place a chest (regular or trapped)
2) Hold an item you would like to sell with said chest shop, and right click said chest. Side of the chest you stand on will affect where the sign for said shop is (you do not need to place a sign).
3) Hit 't' to open chat and type in the price per item of the item you would like to sell.
4) Place item(s) in chest to stock that shop!

*Note: Item may be blacklisted and so you will not be able to progress past #2.
